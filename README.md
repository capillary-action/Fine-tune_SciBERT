# Fine-tune_SciBERT

    - Importing required libraries such as os, re, torch, numpy, transformers, PIL, wand, pytesseract, nltk, and stemmer.
    - Downloading the NLTK stopwords and stemmer data.
    - Loading the SciBERT tokenizer and model.
    - Setting the model to training mode.
    - Defining the training arguments for the model.
    - Creating an empty list to store the formatted text data.
    - Reading the contents of all files in a specified directory into the formatted_text_data list.
    - Defining the stop words and stemmer.
    - Tokenizing and splitting the formatted text data into sequences of length 512 using the SciBERT tokenizer.
    - Creating a PyTorch Dataset from the encoded data.
    - Defining a data collator for language modeling.
    - Creating a Trainer object and training the model using the data collator and the PyTorch Dataset.
    - Generating text from the trained model using the SciBERT tokenizer.
